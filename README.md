## Machine Learning with Rust using Candle

This repository features implementations of algorithms from the Stanford University / Coursera [Machine Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/@machinelearningandai3274), all crafted in Rust using the [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) crate. Each example leverages diverse datasets from Kaggle to demonstrate the algorithms' applications.

All of the examples are CUDA enabled but can run on a machine without a GPU as well, though might be quite slow.
